# AirlineBook

**AirlineBook** is a Flutter application that provides users with information on airlines worldwide. It features a list of all airlines, the ability to mark favorites, a search function to find airlines by name, and supports both dark and light theme modes.

## Features

- **Display all airlines**: View a list of airlines from around the globe.
- **Favorites**: Mark airlines as favorites for quick access.
- **Search**: Easily search for airlines by name.
- **Theme Modes**: Switch between light and dark themes.

## Architecture

This application is developed using the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** pattern to maintain a clean, structured, and testable codebase.
The app uses **flutter_bloc** for state management and implements **dependency injection** with `get_it` to manage dependencies effectively.
